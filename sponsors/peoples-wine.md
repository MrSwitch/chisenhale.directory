People’s Wine Roman Road is a cosy wine bar and shop at the entrance of Roman Road market.

We specialise in low-intervention, artisan wines — mainly French — from independent winemakers. 

It offers a warm, inclusive atmosphere, wine by the glass or bottle, and a menu featuring French cuisine, bistro style. 

Our staff are knowledgeable and super friendly, bringing good vibes to the Roman.
