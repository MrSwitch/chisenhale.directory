BÀRD BOOKS is more than just a bookshop. Alongside the carefully curated bookshelves, it’s a place you can pop in for a coffee or pastry; somewhere to meet friends, make friends, do some work, read a book, write a book, listen to authors, hear some music – just escape. Bookshops are third spaces; “much-loved local haunts that are neither home nor the workplace, but which we rely on for a sense of community and everyday socialising… the lifeblood of our high streets and fundamental to our mental health.” [ROMAN ROAD LDN]. In the evening, the lights dim, and books provide the backdrop for a glass of something deliciously chilled and one of many curated events: quiz, comedy, poetry, books.
