Whether you’re a seasoned cyclist or looking for some information on where to get started, our guide covers the best places to buy cycling equipment and learn from cycling experts near Bow.

Cycling is important not only for travel or recreational exercise but also for the community. Each of the shops listed in our guide is noted for its welcoming and friendly atmosphere. They offer help not only with fixing your bike but with improving your understanding of your bike. We have chosen cycle shops that we believe show a real passion for the craft of bicycles.

Roman Bikes recently opened on Roman Road, filling the void left by Paradise Cycles, which has moved to Bethnal Green.

The small no-fuss shop offers repairs and sells a range of bikes and accessories. It’s right next to ‘Ello Bagels, another newcomer, and on the doorstep of the Ford Road bus stop.

Roman Bikes is an open-plan combined salesroom and workshop, so you can watch your bike get fixed while you browse. Reviews so far say that the service is quick, well-priced and friendly.
