Join local artist (and Chisenhale parent) Nadine Mahoney for a workshop exploring the endless possibilities of coloured glass and make your own fused glass, bowls, coasters or unique art tiles from scratch.

E3 Creative Glass runs regular three-hour workshops (usually the first Saturday of the month) and is also bookable for private sessions. An ideal activity for team building, Hen Parties and unique client offerings.
