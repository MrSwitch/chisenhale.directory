At Stuhl Upholstery, we are passionate about creating beautiful, high-quality
upholstered furniture built to last.
 
Stuhl Upholstery is a sustainable upholstery shop based in Leytonstone, East
London. We work on modern (post 1950s), traditional and custom pieces
using predominantly natural and recycled materials.
 
We can RECOVER your piece, just replacing the top cover, or
REUPHOLSTER if the fillings and springs need a complete overhaul.  Or
something in between.
  
We are exceptional listeners, and love to help bring your ideas to life.   We
take great care of your pieces whether they were your Granny&#39;s heirloom or a
fabulous junk shop find.
 
Get in touch and let’s hear about your project.  We can do home visits and
estimates without obligation to commit.
