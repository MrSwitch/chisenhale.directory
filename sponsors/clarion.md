Here at Clarion, residents are at the heart of everything we do. As well as providing homes for those who need them most, weâ€™re committed to making a difference for our residents and communities, making sure we provide a good service. This includes making you aware of the services we offer and the standard you can expect.

In response to our ongoing engagement with residents on our services, we are delighted to introduce our Clarion Commitments.

The Clarion Commitments will be regularly reviewed to make sure that they continue to reflect what you are telling us. This ensures we focus on the most important issues for you, our residents.

We'll be providing monthly information on our website to share how well we perform against our target for each measure. This shows our progress in delivering our commitments to you.
