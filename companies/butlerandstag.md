Selling & Letting Agent In Bow, Shoreditch, Theydon Bois, Epping, Chingford, Buckhurst Hill & Chelmsford
An award-winning, independent estate agent, Butler & Stag is owned and run by Neil Leahy and Michael Woolley who forged a close friendship while growing up together in Chingford.
As young men, they both embarked on careers as estate agents, quickly ascending the career ladder to become managers at the same company. Having accrued a wealth of experience and with a strong desire to bring a fresh approach to their industry, they decided to go it alone, creating Butler & Stag, a distinctive brand that combines all the best of a traditional estate agent but with a modern, forward-thinking approach.

We love for them all the cash they give the school.
